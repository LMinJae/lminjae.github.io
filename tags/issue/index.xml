Why On previous post, Stream by OBS have a problem, no sound playable. OBS's setting is correct that I checked by Recording. is occured by my mistake. It occured due to hard-coded frequency index in ADTS writer.
In RTMP protocol, Sampling Frequency Index was passing by AudioSpecificConfig. But, It fixed 0x1 in my tcpdump on OBS and ffmpeg.</description></item><item><title>Current status</title><link>https://blog.mjlee.ga/live-streaming/20220323-current-status/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mjlee.ga/live-streaming/20220323-current-status/</guid><description>RTMP is FLV based, so RTMP is best performance on output FLV. (Just write, without modification) As I think, In Low-latency scenario, RTMP=&amp;gt;FLV=&amp;gt;fMP4 has overhead. How about RTMP directly push fMP4 to CDN? Structure of fMP4 ISOBMFF is documented as [ISO/IEC 14496-12].
Mandatory structure is ftyp and moov, that can be found in [Table 1 â€” Box types, structure, and cross-reference (Informative)].
Fragment need pair of moof and mdat.</description></item></channel></rss>
